# UQPINNs-TF2.0
Implementation in TensorFlow 2.0 of different examples put together by Yibo Yang, Paris Perdikaris on their original publication on Adversarial Uncertainty Quantification in Physics Informed Neural Networks.

Building upon previous work by Raissi _et al_ on Physics-Informed Neural Networks, the use of latent variable models and adversarial inference allow for quantifying and propagating the uncertainty when solving or identifying Partial Differential Equations.
